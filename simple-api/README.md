# Simple API with Node.js and Express

This project is a basic API built with Node.js and Express.js as part of the Web3Bridge curriculum. The API includes:
- A root endpoint ("/") that displays a welcome message.
- A GET endpoint (`/api/users`) that returns a list of fictional users.
- A POST endpoint (`/api/users`) that allows adding new users to the list, with error handling for missing fields.

## Running the Project
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the server with `node index.js`
